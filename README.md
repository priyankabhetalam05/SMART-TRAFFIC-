# SMART-TRAFFIC-
Using real-time detection and V2I communication, the system enables dynamic signal control and green corridors for ambulances. If traffic doesn't clear, it reroutes using live traffic data and GPS. This ensures swift movement, reduces delays, and improves emergency response and smart healthcare efficiency.
So, the Proposed Smart System is:
1) Real-time emergency vehicle detection
2) V2l communication for live signal control
3) Network-wide dynamic traffic management
4) Fully automated green corridor creation
5) Minimal human intervention
6) Faster, uninterrupted emergency response
